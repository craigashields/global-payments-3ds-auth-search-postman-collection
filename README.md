  <h1>Global Payments 3DS Authentication Reporting Postman Collection</h1>
  
  <p>
    The Global Payments 3D Secure 2 solution provides complete flexibility for reporting transaction authentications. The search request returns a summary object allowing you to see a high-level outcome of the authentication. You can then follow the standard Obtain Authentication Data step to get more detail, including the data required for authorization.

## Description

I needed to use these Global Payments APIs for some work I was doing so thought I'd put this up as a quick example of calling the APIs and generating the secure hashes using Postman.

Further information can be found on the Global Payments docs site

- [Generate Hash](https://developer.globalpay.com/api/3d-secure-two#generate-hash)
- [Authentication Reporting](https://developer.globalpay.com/ecommerce/3d-secure-version2/authentication-reporting)

The repo provides a Postman Collection and environment that can be imported into Postman.

## Installation
